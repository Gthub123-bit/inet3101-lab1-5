## Background
This project focuses on understanding dynamic memory allocation in C, where memory is managed at runtime rather than compile-time. Unlike static arrays, dynamic memory allows flexible allocation, making it suitable for real-world applications like managing books, student records, or inventory systems.

In this lab, we transitioned from simple structures to a practical example: a book management system. This system allows users to enter book details (title, number, and pages), dynamically allocates memory for each entry, and efficiently displays the results.

## Key C concepts covered include:

Structures: Defining real-world data types.
Dynamic Memory: Using malloc, realloc, and free.
Input Handling: Reading and storing user-provided information.
Memory Safety: Preventing memory leaks through proper deallocation.
This lab reinforces how dynamic memory enables scalable, efficient programming for real-world challenges.
